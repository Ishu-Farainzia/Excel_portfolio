## 📌 Objective
Analyze customer demographics, income, and commute patterns to understand what influences bike purchases.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard)

## 📚 Project Inspiration
This project was created by following a **guided tutorial by [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst)**.  
I replicated the steps, practiced Excel dashboarding, and added my own insights.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Higher income customers are more likely to purchase bikes.  
- Middle-aged customers are the biggest buyer group.  
- Short commute distance (0–1 miles) customers buy bikes the most.  
- Dashboard filters allow analysis by region, marital status, education, and occupation.
